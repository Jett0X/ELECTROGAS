# ELECTROGAS
## Smart Solar Electrolysis for Hydrogen Production with Arduino-Powered Efficiency and Storage Management.
<h2>
    GOALS
</h2>
<h4>    
   Researchers aim to create a sustainable system for producing gas using solar panel-powered electrolysis. To minimize the production of natural gas and produce an alternative gas through the process of electrolysis. By using gas produced by electrolysis, it helps decrease the need for natural gas by providing a renewable and cleaner alternative. The study not only conserves natural gas but also contributes to a more stable and sustainable energy supply.

   EXPECTED OUTCOMES 
</h2>
<h4>
    The study is expected to show that hydrogen gas can potentially and efficiently be produced by solar-powered electrolysis as a renewable substitute for natural gas. This would reduce our dependence on natural gas and minimize emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) for the advantage of the environment. The system should also operate consistently and reliably over time.
